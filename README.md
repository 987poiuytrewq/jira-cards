Generate printable cards from JIRA

If you use Atlassian JIRA to track issues in your project, you may also want to use a physical board to move cards around on.

This project allows you to generate a printable view of your issues. The format layout and style of the output can be controlled with css and html.

Included templates are for printing onto square or oblong post-it notes. You can print a blank template onto a piece of paper, then stick post-it notes to it, then print out your issues directly onto the post-it notes.



Dependencies
============

This project requires python 2.x to run, and also the python module python-jira, install through pip:

pip install jira
